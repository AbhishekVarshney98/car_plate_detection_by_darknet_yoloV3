# Car_plate_detection_by_darknet_yoloV3

This project got it's inspiration to proceed with because of one startup who were about to offer me intern role... This only gave a push to me to explore number of resources get into in-depth knowledge of image processing, object detection and exploring difference between two.
Mostly such type of projects take about 6 months for a novice.
Afterall these projects require in depth rnd and to choose which model suits best to proceed with.
This same happened for me...
But it took me 15 days of rnd and 5 days for execution.
I would have finished this project in 1 week but it took me more than 2 weeks.

- Journey started with in-depth study of image processing.
- Explored blogs, github repos, asked in communities at slack, Facebook groups, telegram groups, read research papers,
- Asked my seniors who were into machine learning, asked people on LinkedIn.

Then after selecting two blogs and corresponding two github repo ,I in-depth studied image processing but further I thought I was about to make a computer vision model but not simply write a code to detect that image.

## Tools could be used:
- Then I explored which language I could use: **MATLAB** or **python**
- Another take was on which library I need to choose **tensorflow** , **keras** , **scikit-learn** , **pytorch**
- How to image could be processed: **using opencv**
- Frameworks could be used: **darknet** , **darkflow(tensorflow version of darknet)** ,**LPRNet** , **Tesseract**
- if wanna go directly with an API then it's : **GoogleVision**

I would have provide a lot blogs which corresponds to above tools which I first try to implement and then got on my final product but
I think it's better to proceed with what I used in final product ðŸ˜Œ

Final product is made using **darknet** framework, **yolov3** weights and used **google colab** so that it could use cloud's hardware for processing and cloud's storage for storing the dataset using it as **IaaS** and **Sar**

- *Have used instructions as per above two repos only. Later one only provide with a command at top to provide final output of dataset.*
- *Further dataset has been directly uploaded to google drive for training the model*
- *Got error with AWS Client while fetching images as per these repos and had solved that by upgrading.*
